						<p class="description">
							Padilla was born as Daniel John Elago Ford on April 26, 1995, in Manila, Philippines. He is the son of actors Rommel Padilla and actress-singer Carla Ford (screen name: Karla Estrada); he is of quarter White American descent from his mother's side.His mother raised Padilla as a single parent. Padilla is the nephew of action star Robin Padilla and BB Gandanghari, and has seven half-siblings from his father's side, including Matt Raprap Padilla, RJ Padilla, Roanna Padilla, and Red Padilla, and three younger half-siblings from his mother's side, JC Padilla, Margaret Planas, and Carmella Tenorio.Padilla met his siblings from his father's side in 2011 when he turned sixteen.
                            Padilla lived for a year in Tacloban and studied there (grade 4).In 2014 he registered as an AMA Education System's student. Due to the tight schedule, he reportedly took the home study program of UST Angelicum College years back.Padilla finally shared his plans to go back to school after his mother, Karla Estrada, announced on Magandang Buhay that she wants all her children to finish their studies.
                            Padilla was discovered by the late talent manager Douglas Quijano who pushed him to audition on Star Magic. He was introduced to the media as a member of the Star Magic Circle 2013. At a press conference in 2013, Padilla said he never imagined ending up in entertainment, but he thinks that he is in show business for a more important reason since his family went through financial difficulties.
